# SimulatedAnnealing
Discrete landscape optimization: Simulated annealing vs. Greedy strategy.
The project aims to explore the landscape defined by a discrete function represented by a matrix, where each entry holds the value of your target function for two inputs (column and row). 
The objective is to minimize this function through simulated annealing and a greedy strategy; comparing the performances.
